# JobPortal
### **Project Overview**
The Mini Job Portal System is a console-based application developed using Core Java that simulates a simplified online job portal. The system allows different types of users—Admin, Company, and Candidate—to interact with the portal based on their roles. This project is built without using any databases or frameworks, and all data is managed in-memory using Java Collections. It focuses on implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, role-based access, and validation logic through a menu-driven interface.

### **Objectives**
- To understand and implement Core Java concepts in a real-world scenario
- To apply OOP principles such as Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation
- To work with Java Collections (List, Set, Map) for data management
- To implement role-based functionality
- To enforce business rules and validations
- To build a menu-driven console application

### **Technologies Used**

- Concepts: 
 1.  OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation) 
 2. Collections Framework 
 3. Exception Handling 
 4. equals() and hashCode()
